## 🎯 The Mission
As a CS student at **Université Paris-Saclay**, I don't just write code; I orchestrate AI agents. This repository documents my personal "Vibe Coding" stack—the exact tools I use to turn ideas into deployed apps in hours, not weeks.

**Status:** `Production Ready` 🟢

## 🧠 1. The Brains (LLMs)
*The engines driving the logic.*

| Tool | Role | Why "Zlarex" uses it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Architect | Unbeatable for complex reasoning and system architecture. Less hallucinations than GPT-4o for code structure. |
| **GPT-4o** | Generalist | Great for quick scripts, brainstorming, and multimodal tasks (images/diagrams). |
| **Perplexity** | Researcher | My replacement for Google. Perfect for finding documentation and fixing obscure error logs instantly. |

## 🛠️ 2. The Flow (IDE & Editor)
*Where the magic happens.*

### ⚡ Cursor (The Editor)
*Forget VS Code.* Cursor is a fork of VS Code with AI baked into the core.
- **Killer Feature:** `Cmd+K` to generate code, `Cmd+L` to chat with your codebase.
- **My Config:** I use "Composer Mode" to edit multiple files simultaneously.

### 🤖 GitHub Copilot (The Wingman)
- **Role:** Autocomplete & Boilerplate killer.
- **Usage:** It handles the boring stuff (imports, basic functions) so I can focus on logic.

### 🎨 Lovable (The Front-End Wizard)
- **Role:** Idea to UI in seconds.
- **Usage:** I use Lovable to generate the entire frontend infrastructure (React + Tailwind) from a simple prompt, then export to GitHub to refine the logic.

## 🔐 3. Security & Ops (The "Zlarex" Touch)
*Building robust systems.*

* **Applied Cryptography:** Working with `ChaCha20` for secure data storage.
* **Voice AI:** Experimenting with **Vapi** and **Pipecat** for sub-500ms latency voice agents.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Don't just copy-paste.** Understand the code the AI gives you.
2. **Iterate.** AI is a colleague, not a slave. Challenge its output.
3. **Ship.** The goal is to deploy, not just to code.
