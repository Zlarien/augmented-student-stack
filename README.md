## 🎯 The Mission
As a CS student at **Université Paris-Saclay**, I don't just write code; I orchestrate AI agents. This repository documents my personal "Augmented" stack—the exact tools I use to turn ideas into deployed apps in hours, not weeks.

**Status:** `Production Ready` 🟢

## 🧠 1. The Brains (Model Layer)
*The engines driving the logic. I choose the right brain for the right task.*

| Tool | Role | Why "Zlarex" uses it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gemini (Advanced)** | **The Architect** | My go-to for complex Context Engineering, coding logic, and academic work. It handles large context windows better than anything else for project-wide reasoning. |
| **ChatGPT** | **The Assistant** | The daily driver for quick questions, life organization, and "banal" queries. Fast and reliable. |
| **GitHub Copilot** | **The Wingman** | **My #1 Tool.** I use it inside VS Code to switch between models (o1, Sonnet 3.5) instantly. Its "Next Edit Suggestion" (Agentic AI) takes initiatives in the background before I even ask. |

> *Note on Perplexity:* I used to use it for research, but shifted workflow due to limited access to top-tier reasoning models (Sonnet) in the pro version.

## 🛠️ 2. The Flow (IDE & Execution)
*Where the magic happens.*

### ⚡ VS Code + GitHub Copilot (The Core)
My customized environment. I don't just use autocomplete; I use Copilot as an active pair programmer.
- **Workflow:** I leverage Copilot's ability to "predict" my next move across multiple files.
- **Why not Cursor?** While Cursor is an excellent fork (highly recommended for beginners), I prefer the native integration of Copilot within VS Code for a cleaner, more modular experience.

### 🎨 Lovable (The UI Wizard)
- **Role:** Idea to Interface.
- **Usage:** I use Lovable to scaffold entire frontend infrastructures (React + Tailwind) from a single prompt, allowing me to focus on the backend logic.

### 💻 Claude Code
- **Role:** The Terminal Agent.
- **Usage:** Great for CLI-based refactoring and quick script generation directly in the terminal.

## 🔐 3. Security & Ops (The "Zlarex" Touch)
*Building robust systems.*

* **Applied Cryptography:** Implementing `ChaCha20` for secure data storage (Code over API).
* **Identity:** Keeping a clear distinction between "Zlarex" (The Builder) and my academic persona.

## 🧬 The "Augmented" Philosophy
Tools are useless without methodology. Here is how I work:
1. **Context is King:** I use Gemini to build massive context prompts before writing a single line of code.
2. **AI Initiative:** I let GitHub Copilot suggest the path, but **I** drive the car. I review every line.
3. **Iterative Shipping:** Build the UI with Lovable, refine the logic with Copilot, deploy, repeat.
